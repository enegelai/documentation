Generative AI Powered Continuous CX Improvement

### What you'll need
To effectively utilize our product, specific resources are necessary to lay the foundation. Start by gathering voice recordings illustrating the interactions between agents and customers. These may include customer service calls, sales conversations, or other relevant dialogues. Following this, transcribe these voice recordings into text transcripts. However, if you already have these transcripts available or if you're analyzing text from chat conversations, you may skip the transcription process.

Our system analyzes these text transcripts to deliver a robust set of insights and coaching materials designed to assist agents in their roles.

In the event that you're using a chatbot or voicebot, our product is designed to interface directly with these systems. This functionality allows our product to collect and process data in real-time, greatly enhancing its ability to generate comprehensive and actionable insights. It's essential to ensure that your chatbot or voicebot is correctly configured to share data with our product to optimize outcomes.

To maximize your experience with our product, it's crucial to ensure that you have access to the required resources or that your bots are correctly set up. The provision of these elements allows our software to deliver insights that can markedly enhance your customer interactions and overall business operations.
