# Scenarios

Scenarios delineate what you intend to accomplish with a conversation. These objectives primarily fall into three categories:

- Analyzing existing Conversation Transcripts to summarize the conversation, identify issues, recommend solutions, and calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

- Transcribing existing audio recordings to facilitate further analysis of these recordings.

- Initiating a phone call (either to an IVR system or an agent), engaging in conversation, processing audio in real-time, and analyzing the conversation. This includes summarizing the dialogue, identifying issues, recommending solutions, and calculating KPIs.

To execute a scenario, it's required to create and run a job.
